LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND COMPLIANCE DISCLOSURE

Project: PasswordLab

--------------------------------------------------

1. LEGAL STANDING AND INTENT (MENS REA)

The operator of this repository ("Researcher") maintains this environment for academic and forensic benchmarking. Under most global legal systems (including India's IPC and IT Act), a crime requires Mens Rea (criminal intent). This project lacks such intent and is focused on hardware performance analysis.

--------------------------------------------------

2. CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROTECTIONS (INDIA)

Article 19(1)(g):
Protection of the right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade, or business (Cybersecurity Research).

IT Act 2000, Section 43:
No unauthorized access is performed. All auditing is conducted on hashes legally owned by the researcher or provided via public datasets for benchmarking.

IT Act 2000, Section 66:
This tool is not used for dishonest or fraudulent purposes. Performance optimization of open-source software is a protected activity.

--------------------------------------------------

3. DOCTRINE OF FAIR USE AND DUAL-USE TOOLS

PasswordLab utilizes dual-use tools (software that can be used for both security and auditing). The possession of security software is not an offense.

Fair Use:
Reproduction of cryptographic logic for research, benchmarking, and education is protected under fair use doctrines.

--------------------------------------------------

4. DATA PROVENANCE

The researcher commits to:

- Never processing data obtained via unauthorized intrusion
- Only auditing files with explicit legal authorization or ownership
- Using the platform to verify the strength of personal encryption

--------------------------------------------------

5. LIABILITY LIMITATION

This software is provided "as-is." The researcher is not responsible for misuse by third parties. This environment is a controlled laboratory for RISC architecture study.
